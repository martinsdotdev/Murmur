/**
 * Murmur's service worker.
 *
 * Two staging rules the code cannot state on its own:
 *
 *  - The shell installs atomically. dist/app/index.html is an astro-island
 *    placeholder and nothing else, so a precache holding the document without
 *    MurmurApp.js paints a blank dark page with no error and no spinner. A
 *    partial shell is worse than none, which is what Workbox's all-or-nothing
 *    install buys.
 *  - The 17.6 MB of audio is staged after activation, driven by a message from
 *    the page. Nothing on that path may reach install or activate, because a
 *    client waits for a worker to finish activating and would sit behind the
 *    whole download.
 *
 * No top-level export in this file. vite-plugin-pwa builds it with
 * inlineDynamicImports and registers it as a classic worker, so an emitted
 * `export {}` would fail with "Unexpected token 'export'".
