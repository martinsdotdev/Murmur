/**
 * The landing page and the /app mixer share one theme contract:
 * localStorage['theme'] holds the *preference* ('light' | 'dark' | 'system')
 * and <html data-theme> holds the *resolution* ('light' | 'dark').
 *
 * ThemeBootstrap.astro does the first resolution before paint. A stored
 * 'system' is neither 'light' nor 'dark', so it falls through to its matchMedia
 * branch. This module keeps the two in step afterwards.
 *
 * ThemeToggle.astro on the landing page writes only 'light' or 'dark', so it
 * can override a stored 'system' but cannot restore it. Only Preferences can.
