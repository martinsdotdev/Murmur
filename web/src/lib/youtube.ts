/**
 * YouTube sounds, the browser half of Murmur/Services/YouTubeAudioImportService.cs.
 *
 * The desktop resolves a watch URL to an audio-only stream with YoutubeExplode
 * and hands the URL to AudioGraph. None of that is possible here: YouTube's
 * player endpoints send no Access-Control-Allow-Origin, and neither does
 * googlevideo.com, so even a stream URL in hand would decode to nothing. The
 * site is static, so there is no server to proxy through either.
 *
 * What is left is the IFrame Player API, a real embedded player we drive with
 * setVolume(0-100) instead of a GainNode. It is hidden, which YouTube's
 * developer policies do not permit; that is a deliberate product decision,
 * taken so a YouTube sound behaves like every other card in the mixer.
 *
 * Two consequences worth knowing before touching this file:
 *  - setVolume is a no-op on iOS, where HTMLMediaElement.volume is read-only.
 *    Nothing here can fix that; the mixer's slider is simply inert on iPhone.
 *  - There is no single-video loop parameter, so ENDED is caught and rewound.
